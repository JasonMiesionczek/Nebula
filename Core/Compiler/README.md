Compiler
========

The goal of the compiler is to take the AST generated by the parser, which represents the input code, and generate a structure which represents the output code for a given language.

For each language, a series of objects will be defined that describe how the AST should look for that language. 

For many languages, pieces of single concept must be placed in different locations within the source file. This presents some challenges when generating the output code.
To handle this, each component can expose one or more 'events' that correspond to the different areas of the code where extra things may need to be placed. Each component
can also register handles for these events both from within themselves, and any other components, and provide their custom output for that section.
